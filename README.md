# AdventofCode2024
My solutions for Advent of Code 2024. 2nd year playing. Have my python skills increased? We'll find out.
8 stars in 2023.
I haven't had the time to complete a lot but I'll keep working on them as I have time.
I'm using branches until both parts of a day are completed to merge to main.

    Day 1: Completed.
    
    Day 2: Ugh.. WIP

    Day 3: Part 1 Completed; Part 2 WIP
